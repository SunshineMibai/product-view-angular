# Product View written in Angular 1

## Introduction

This application is a learning example, creating a view in Angular1 that can be backed by a REST service.

## Technologies

The following technologies are explored in this and associated samples:

* Docker
* A small amount of Node.js to serve the content
* Angular 1 with external service integration
* limited Bootstrap.js just to avoid manual hacking of CSS


## Versions

Version | Description
--------|------------
0.0.1 | basic example that allows the app to stand up and display itself with two integration options (no data source, or the REST datasource)
0.0.2 | Added better doco


## TODO

* Consider using Angular 1 templates to insert test data
* add dependent systems to dockerhub
* update the implementation to support and aggregate multiple datasources
